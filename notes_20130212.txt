George Boole (1815 - 1864)
English mathematician, philosopher, and logician
invented Boolean logic.

Boolean algebra
two values,
"Boolean expressions" are operations on Boolean variables
Main operations:
----------------
Conjunction (and)	 ^ 
Disjunction (or)	 V
Negation (not)		 ¬  

Other Operations:
-----------------
Exclusive Disjunction (exclusive or)	J, XOR
NAND (negation on a conjunction)	¬ (A ^ B)  
NOR (negation on a disjunction)		¬ (A V B)

Order of Operations: Disjunction
